# NEF Conceptors
Implementing Conceptors in the NEF for SYDE552.

## How to Run
    1. Run `pattern.py` to generate pattern results into a `.m` file from spiking neurons using the NEF.
    2. Run `section2.3_demoMotionCapture/no_NN.m` to generate the MoCap files. This works by loading the decoded data from the `.m` file and passing it into `nnRaw2jHJ_absH` as the first argument.
