We need to find a way to make it so that when switching between patterns,
they sync up nicely. Consequently, we have to:
- Read about inverse DMPs
- Read about how Conceptors do the syncing up nicely stuff
	a) via the technical reports
	b) via the matlab code

What's with the awkward bump in arctan2 approximation and how do I get rid of it?
The reset period of the animation is going to be jerky as hell, do
rythmic DMPs show me how to do it more smoothly?
