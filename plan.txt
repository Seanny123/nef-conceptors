Find out the minimum resolution you can plug the values into the mo-cap generator.

What's with the awkward bump in arctan2 approximation and how do I get rid of it?
That's just a shitty approximation of the function, switching to direct neurons will solve that problem.

The reset period of the animation is going to be jerky as hell, do
rythmic DMPs show me how to do it more smoothly?
If you use direct neurons and put zero filtering on the synapses, the transition will be instantaneous.

What will that mean for biological plausibility?
Well, our representation of the dynamics will still be biologically plausible, but the manipulation of them certainly won't be. This will just be an indication that approximating dynamics from motion-capture and then directly shoving them into your output probably isn't a great idea.

What if my pattern isn't symmetrical around +pi and -pi?
Well, then I guess we force it to be symmetrical? Or I guess it doesn't matter since there's only so much change a neuron can do anyways...
Worst comes to worst it makes the repeat of the action weird.
If that's the case, try smoothing via elongation of action
