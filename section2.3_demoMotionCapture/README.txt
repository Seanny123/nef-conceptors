This folder contains everything needed to reproduce the motion capture demo described in the paper "Using conceptors to manage neural long-term memories for temporal patterns", H. Jaeger 2015. 

Running the "mocapDemo_MasterScript" should immediately reproduce the entire motion capture simulation. The resulting video in mp4 format is included as file video15motions.mp4.

Data: motion capture source data were retrieved from the MoCap repository maintained at CMU http://mocap.cs.cmu.edu/ . Fifteen mocap traces were used. The raw downloaded data are in c3d format and collected in the folder rawMocapData. Since the total filesize is almost 100 MB, this folder is not included in this package. If you wish to work with the original data, download that folder from XXX

Mocap toolbox: For data format transformations and visualizations I relied on the Matlab mocap toolbox from the University of Jyväskylä, https://www.jyu.fi/hum/laitokset/musiikki/en/research/coe/materials/mocaptoolbox. The toolbox is in the folder MoCapToolbox_v1.4. I changed some of the original toolbox files and renamed them; these additions are also in MoCapToolbox_v1.4. 

The raw mocap data from the CMU repository come in heterogenous formattings (specifically, the joint numbering differs across individual mocap trace files). It's a pain to manually unify the formats and create normalized versions that are inputs for the neural network. All of this is done in the scripts named "makeNNData_…". I did not bother to tidy up and comment these "makeNNData…" files - you need to familiarize yourself anyway with the mocap toolbox before you can start doing your own work with this kind of data. The results of this preprocessing are standardized 61-dimensional signals (described in the article; most are relative joint angles). These preprocessed, normalized data are contained in the folder nnData. If you wish to just play with the neural network, conceptors, and visualization (creating your own choreographies), you can do a lot by just using these ready-made preprocessed files and not bother about their generation from the source mocap data: just set the "makeAllDataFlag" variable in the "mocapDemo_MasterScript" to 0 and the preprocessing is skipped. 

I will not (even try to) give support concerning the preprocessing -- you are on your own there. It's involved stuff, the available mocap toolbox documentation is somewhat sketchy (though the authors did a admirable job for free, writing the manual of 139 pages [included in the folder MoCapToolbox_v1.4]), and if you want to dig into it, be prepared to burn some self-tutoring time.
